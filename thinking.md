Be specific with your next goal so you can keep moving - and so you can research! What is your next immediate task?

I need to render the object. But I specifically need to render each object value (array) as a line item, which then gets inserted into the Record area.

So let's break that down into separate tasks.

1. render the object
  a. iterate through the Object
  b. render the value (array) for each key
  c. apply <li> to the line
  d. insert that into the Record section, which needs to be an ul if it's not already
